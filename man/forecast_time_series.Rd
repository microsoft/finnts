\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A data frame or tibble of historical time series data. Can also include external regressors for both
historical and future data.}

\item{combo_variables}{List of column headers within input data to be used to separate individual time series.}

\item{target_variable}{The column header formatted as a character value within input data you want to forecast.}

\item{date_type}{The date granularity of the input data. Finn accepts the following as a character string
day, week, month, quarter, year.}

\item{forecast_horizon}{Number of periods to forecast into the future.}

\item{external_regressors}{List of column headers within input data to be used as features in multivariate models.}

\item{run_name}{Name used when submitting jobs to external compute like Azure Batch. Formatted as a character string.}

\item{hist_start_date}{Date value of when your input_data starts. Default of NULL is to use earliest date value in
input_data.}

\item{hist_end_date}{Date value of when your input_data ends.Default of NULL is to use the latest date value in
input_data.}

\item{combo_cleanup_date}{Date value to remove individual time series that don't contain non-zero values after
that specified date. Default of NULL is to not remove any time series and attempt to forecast all of them.}

\item{fiscal_year_start}{Month number of start of fiscal year of input data, aids in building out date features.
Formatted as a numeric value. Default of 1 assumes fiscal year starts in January.}

\item{clean_missing_values}{Should missing values be inputted? Only inputes values for missing data within an
existing series, and does not add new values onto the beginning or end, but does provide a value of 0 for said
values.}

\item{clean_outliers}{Should outliers be cleaned and inputted with values more in line with historical data?}

\item{back_test_scenarios}{Number of specific back test folds to run when determining the best model.
Default of 'auto' will automatially choose the number of back tests to run based on historical data size,
which tries to always use a minimum of 80\% of the data when training a model.}

\item{back_test_spacing}{Number of periods to move back for each back test scenario. Default of 'auto' moves back 1
period at a time for year, quarter, and month data. Moves back 4 for week and 7 for day data.}

\item{modeling_approach}{How Finn should approach your data. Current default and only option is 'accuracy'. In the
future this could evolve to other areas like optimizing for interpretability over accuracy.}

\item{forecast_approach}{How the forecast is created. The default of 'bottoms_up' trains models for each individual
time series. 'grouped_hierarchy' creates a grouped time series to forecast at while 'standard_hierarchy' creates
a more traditional hierarchical time series to forecast, both based on the hts package.}

\item{parallel_processing}{Default of 'none' runs no parallel processing and forecasts each individual time series
one after another. 'local_machine' leverages all cores on current machine Finn is running on. 'azure_batch'
runs time series in parallel on a remote compute cluster in Azure Batch.}

\item{run_model_parallel}{Run model training in parallel, only works when parallel_processing is set to
'local_machine' or 'azure_batch'.}

\item{num_cores}{The number of cores to use when running parallel processing, either on local machine or in cloud.
Default of 'auto' will use 2/3 of available cores. Users can also supply their own number to use, formatted as a numeric value.}

\item{azure_batch_credentials}{Credentials to run parallel_processing in Azure Batch.}

\item{azure_batch_cluster_config}{Compute cluster specification to run parallel_processing in Azure Batch.}

\item{azure_batch_cluster_delete}{Delete the Azure Batch compute cluster after Finn finished running.}

\item{target_log_transformation}{Log transform target variable before training models.}

\item{negative_fcst}{Allow forecasts to dip below zero.}

\item{fourier_periods}{List of values to use in creating fourier series as features. Default of NULL automatically chooses
these values based on the date_type.}

\item{lag_periods}{List of values to use in creating lag features. Default of NULL automatically chooses these values
based on date_type.}

\item{rolling_window_periods}{List of values to use in creating rolling window features. Default of NULL automatically
chooses these values based on date_type.}

\item{reticulate_environment}{File path to python environment to use when training gluonts deep learning models.
Only important when parallel_processing is not set to 'azure_batch'. Azure Batch should use its own docker image
that has python environment already installed.}

\item{models_to_run}{List of models to run. Default of NULL runs all models.}

\item{models_not_to_run}{List of models not to run, overrides values in models_to_run. Default of NULL doesn't turn off
any model.}

\item{run_deep_learning}{Run deep learning models from gluonts (deepar and nbeats). Overrides models_to_run and
models_not_to_run.}

\item{run_global_models}{Run multivariate models on the entire data set (across all time series) as a global model.
Can be override by models_to_run and models_not_to_run.}

\item{run_local_models}{Run models by individual time series as local models.}

\item{average_models}{Create simple averages of individual models.}

\item{max_model_average}{Max number of models to average together. Will create model averages for 2 models up until input value
or max number of models ran.}

\item{weekly_to_daily}{Convert a week forecast down to day by evenly splitting across each day of week. Helps when aggregating
up to higher temporal levels like month or quarter.}
