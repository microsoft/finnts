The Microsoft Finance Time Series Forecasting Framework, aka finnts or Finn, is an automated forecasting framework for producing financial forecasts. While it was built for corporate finance activities, it can easily expand to any time series forecasting problem!

-   Built in AI agent that can act as your own virtual data scientist, always optimizing for the most accurate forecast.
-   Automated feature engineering, feature selection, back testing, and model selection.
-   Access to 25+ models. Both univariate and multivariate models.
-   Azure integration to run thousands of time series in parallel within the cloud.
-   Supports daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly forecasts.
-   Handles external regressors, either purely historical or historical+future values.

## Installation

### CRAN version

``` r
install.packages("finnts")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of finnts from GitHub.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("microsoft/finnts")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(finnts)

# prepare historical data
hist_data <- timetk::m4_monthly %>%
  dplyr::rename(Date = date) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(id = as.character(id))
  
# connect LLM
driver_llm <- ellmer::chat_azure_openai(model = "gpt-4o-mini")

# set up new forecast project and agent run
project <- set_project_info(project_name = "Demo_Project", 
                            combo_variables = c("id"),
                            target_variable = "value",
                            date_type = "month")
                            
agent <- set_agent_info(project_info = project,
                        driver_llm = driver_llm,
                        input_data = hist_data,
                        forecast_horizon = 6)

# iterate forecast via agent
iterate_forecast(agent_info = agent,
                 max_iter = 3,
                 weighted_mape_goal = 0.03)

# load final forecast output
forecast_output <- get_agent_forecast(agent_info = agent)

# ask agent to explain the forecast results
eda_answer <- ask_agent(agent_info = agent,
                        question = "Summarize the exploratory data analysis, what stands out?")
                        
accuracy_answer <- ask_agent(agent_info = agent,
                             question = "What's the best model accuracy?")
                             
model_answer <- ask_agent(agent_info = agent,
                          question = "Explain why the best model was selected.")
```
